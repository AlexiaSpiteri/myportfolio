                <p class="cpt">Journal is of overall good quality in terms of research as well as ability to interpret
                    the characteristics of the styles and movements. Good work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lct-cmt-card">
                <p class="cpt">You discussed the impact of album covers on graphic design and interactive media well,
                    with a good introduction and interesting points. Context was well-discussed, and examples from
                    graphic design were used. Overall, the work is fair, but there is room for improvement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lct-cmt-card">
                <p class="cpt">Essay is interesting and well researched. Replicas are also well researched and executed
                    with a very good level of independent research overall.</p>
