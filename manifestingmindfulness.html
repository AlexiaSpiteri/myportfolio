        <h3>Mindfulness Blog Magazine</h3>
        <h4>Web Design Assignment</h4>

        <img src="Assets/manifestingmindfulness.png" alt="manifestingmindfulness">

        <p> I built this blog website as part of my Web Design unit. The brief required analysis of existing websites
            that are similar to my desired project, a survey to sum up the average user feedback, idea generation to
            come up with a style guide and a design plan, wireframes, and finally coding. </p>

        </div>

        <p>Through the surveys, it was concluded that the average customer is 22 years old and frequently uses social
            media such as Instagram, Tiktok, and Facebook. It was also revealed that the average user has browsed blog
            websites before and would expect contact information, a menu bar, high quality media, and easy navigation.
            They admired the simplicty and the use of thumbnails in the websites that served as inspiration for me.
            However, they found some of them to be disorganised and one of them to have an unlegible font.
        </p>

        <div class="site-map">
            <img src="Assets/site-map.png" alt="site-map">
        </div>

        <p>Moving on to the site map, I jotted down all of the sections and tabs that each of the three websites
            above contained on a notebook. I then eliminated those which were deemed repetitive or unnecessary for my
            own website. My aim was to maintain the simplicity aspect as mindfulness is all about calm and declutter.
        </p>

        <div class="site-map">
            <img src="Assets/style-guide.png" alt="style-guide">
        </div>

        <p> This led me to develop my style guide, which was inspired by examples found online. This included the
            logo design, the colour palette that I might use, and the typefaces and fonts for each text.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also included in this style guide are samples of buttons that I could use, and the social media icons.
            All of this was done using Adobe Illustrator before a mock-up on Figma was designed.
        </p>

        <div class="wireframes">
            <img src="Assets/about-page.png" alt="about-page">
            <img src="Assets/blog-post-page.png" alt="blog-post-page">
            <img src="Assets/contact-me-page.png" alt="contact-me-page">
        </div>

        <p>
            The wireframing part was the most challenging as the components had to be extremely simplistic and there
            were many options on how to approach this blog website. In fact, as I was coding, I adjusted some of the
            layout of these wireframes to something more functional and easy to navigate. The above are some examples of
            the wireframes that I submitted.
        </p>

        <p> Here is the
            <a href="Assets/Mock-Up.png"> mock-up</a>
            that was conducted on Figma.

                <p class="cpt">Good job on data gathering and interpretation. The websites used for inspiration were
                    well studied. Design guidelines were solid, but labeling specific elements and visuals would have
                    been helpful.</p>

            <div class="lct-cmt-card">
                <p class="cpt">Your work is consistent and pays attention to details. Fix minor HTML validation issues
                    and use one CSS file for the website. The contact page is well-structured, but some user data
                    doesn't transfer due to missing field names. Consider collecting more content before backing up to
                    GitHub.</p>
