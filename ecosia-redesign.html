        <h3>Ecosia Redesign</h3>
        <h4>Personal Project</h4>

        <p> During my first few months experimenting with digital design, I got interested in the Ecosia search engine
            as it is less popular than other search engines such as Google and Yahoo!, and its purpose was not only to
            serve as a search engine but to also help the environment.</p>

        <p> This search engine essentially helps the environment by planting trees according to the searches that its
            users make. </p>

        <p> This is how the Ecosia search engine looked before the rebrand: </p>

        <img src="assets/old-ecosia.jpg" alt="old-ecosia">

        <p> Ecosia then released a rebrand of their search engine to look like this:</p>

        <img src="assets/rebrand.png" alt="ecosia-rebrand">

        <p> Nothing extremely bothered me with this rebrand. I think that it was needed and more modern than the
            original design. However, I think that their logo could be better and more representative of their
            objective as a search engine.
        </p>

        <p> During this time, I was watching a lot of graphic design videos on YouTube for my assignments and noticed a
            pattern. When redesigning, most would create a moodboard of the exising design. Then, they search for
            similar products and analyse what design techniques and effects are commonly used to create their logo.
            Therefore, I did the same thing for my first redesign attempt.</p>

        <p>
            Regarding the most popular search engines, I noticed that there is a common use of bold sans-serif fonts and
            flat designs. Keeping that in mind, I experimented with some typefaces and kept the ones I liked most.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/ecosia-typefaces.png" alt="ecosia-typefaces">

        <p> Out of the three typefaces above, I liked the top-right one the most. However, I thought that it was lacking
            a bit to be used as a logo. Therefore, I rounded the edges using Adobe Illustrator and that made it much
            better. I eventually came up with the logo below, which incorporates both my new typeface and their new
            logo. I then designed a quick mock-up, but quickly learned that it had some flaws. </p>

        </div>

        <p> I also experimented with the app logo.</p>
