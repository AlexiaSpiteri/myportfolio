        <h3>Mobile Application Prototype</h3>
        <h4>Interactive Media Fundamentals Assignment</h4>

        <div class="app">

        <p> This a prototype of a mobile application that was designed on MarvelAppl.com for the Interactive Media
            Fundamentals unit. The class was assigned to design any mobile application that we liked, and I opted for a
            cake designing application that is not just a game, but it also let's its users order the cakes that they
            design. Different bakers can be chosen based on their profile and reviews. This concept was derived from my
            baking hobby. </p>

        <div class="app">
            <img src="Assets/005.jpg" alt="terms-conditions">
            <img src="Assets/006.jpg" alt="choose-location">
            <img src="Assets/007.jpg" alt="contact-or-design">
            <img src="Assets/008.jpg" alt="choose-baker">
        </div>

        <p>This idea came about after conducting some research on creative or interesting application ideas. Some
            concepts which were considered include a rebrand of the Tallinja mobile app, and a smart sparking
            application. After some thought, however, I came up with the final idea, which was this cake design app, as
            I noticed that there are not many apps that offer this service. This makes my idea more unique and more
            likely to be appreciated by the users.
        </p>

        <div class="wireframes-list">
            <p> This led me to the first phase of designing, which was figuring out all of the wireframes and features
                to include and in which order they will follow each other. This included the landing page, the log-in or
                sign-up page, the different layers of the cake, cake accessories page, and order checkout. Also noted
                were the different flavours and fillings, as well as the payment confirmation message.

        <p>Next step was to design the logo of the mobile application. This came to be a bit challenging because logo
            design is not one of my best strengths. Therefore, I went with a simple wordmark logo with some cake-like
            effects on the characters, such as a sugar glaze. A cute cake was then designed to be the mascot of the app.

        <p> These were some of the ideas for the mascot: </p>

        <div class="wireframes-list">
            <p> When the style was decided, I moved on to prepare the icons. This was useful as MarvelApp.com only
                provides a few ready-made elements, and this application required many unique icons.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most challenging part of this phase was trying to style each icon isn such a way that all icons
                match each other to follow through with consistency. This was my first attempt at such designs, and,
                therefore, my knowledge on Adobe Illustrator was limited.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of these icons were done by simply tracing an image and adjusting it to my desired look, such as
                the fruit icons and the flag icons.

                <p class="cpt">Your submission exceeded expectations in conceptualizing the various concepts of
                    interactive media and describing the use of contemporary media systems, such as the Wolt food app,
                    including its user base and UI experience. The presented findings and research were structured and
                    presented in a professional manner.</p>

            <div class="lct-cmt-card">
                <p class="cpt">You presented a thorough analysis of an existing mobile application through wireframes
                    and graphic elements. The development of your own mobile application idea is well-presented with a
                    good range of wireframes. Your exploration of various elements for the application creation led to
                    an interesting idea.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lct-cmt-card">
                <p class="cpt">Your mobile application idea was well-refined with an average visual quality and a good
                    number of screens. It functioned well, but with some accessibility issues. Some design elements
                    could have been distributed better. Researching UI design trends could improve the dated aspects.
                    Overall, a good job for a first-time mobile application.</p>
